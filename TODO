General:
✓ Implement all funcitions in list.c as an ArrayList
- Add a better macro to control function names in list.h
- Edit all functions to take into account sub lists
✓ Finish retainAll function (Hint: very similar to removeAll)
- Implement interfaces such as Collection, List, Map, etc.
- Debating on how to distinguish types. Maybe enum in each Interface or hash functions?
- Finish working on recursive build system using Make (Can't distiguish what needs to be made)

Refactoring:
✓ Line 267 in list.c move if statement to its own static function
- Update comments to be more alligned with C  ex: no exceptions
- Fix some "int" strings in comments got replaced with "int64_t" strings

Bugs:
- Line 316 in list.c unexpected behavior when arrLength > (arrList->size - index)


Checkmark {Macro: @c} (for when I finish something): ✓
