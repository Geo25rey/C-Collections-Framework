General:
- Implement all funcitions in list.c as an ArrayList
- Add a better macro to control function names in list.h

Refactoring:
✓ Line 267 in list.c move if statement to its own static function
- Update comments to be more alligned with C  ex: no exceptions
- Fix some "int" strings in comments got replaced with "int64_t" strings


Checkmark (for when I finish something): ✓
